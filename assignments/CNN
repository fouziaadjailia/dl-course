# Team project assignment - Convolutional Neural Network.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an emerging trend in the recent years. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on large datasets available in advance. Therefore, for this assignment you will develop a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm able to play a board game.

## Research goal and expected output
The goal of this assignment is to create 


academic paper with a literature review, methodology and results to be published in the university's journal or a journal with better rating


## Milestones
theoretical overview of Convolution neural networks
algorithm and architecture proposal
working demo
overview paper in LaTeX
working model


## Literature
a list of some research papers that introduce the students to the problem, methodology, and technologies
